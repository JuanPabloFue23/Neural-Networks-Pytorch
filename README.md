# 📚 Introduction to Neural Networks with PyTorch

This repository contains my notes and code from the **Introduction to Neural Networks with PyTorch** course offered by **IBM**.  
The goal of this course is to learn the fundamentals of neural networks and their implementation in **PyTorch**, from basic concepts to building classification models.

## ✅ Course Content

The course is divided into **6 modules**:

### **Module 1: Tensor and Datasets**
- Basics of **tensors** (1D and 2D) and the `numel` method.
- Differentiation: simple and partial derivatives.
- PyTorch attributes for derivative calculation.
- Creating classes and objects for **datasets**, including image datasets.

---

### **Module 2: Linear Regression**
- Introduction to **linear regression**.
- Building custom modules using `nn.Module`.
- Using `state_dict()` to manage model parameters.
- Training the model, calculating **loss**, and applying **Gradient Descent**.

---

### **Module 3: Linear Regression PyTorch Way**
- Implementing **Stochastic Gradient Descent** with `DataLoader`.
- Batch processing: Mini-Batch vs Stochastic GD.
- Using PyTorch optimization modules.
- Data splitting and tuning **hyperparameters**.

---

### **Module 4: Multiple Input Output Linear Regression**
- Linear regression with multiple inputs and outputs.
- Model parameters, cost calculation, and gradient descent in PyTorch.

---

### **Module 5: Logistic Regression for Classification**
- Fundamentals of **linear classifiers** and logistic regression.
- Building networks with `nn.Sequential`.
- Statistical concepts: **Bernoulli Distribution**, **MLE**.
- Implementing **Cross Entropy Loss**.

---

### **Module 6: Final Project**
